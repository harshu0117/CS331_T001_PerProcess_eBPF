## What is this folder?

This folder documents how we used AI to build, debug, and test our eBPF network tracker. 

Instead of just asking ChatGPT for code snippets, we used **Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`)**, an agentic AI coding tool that can read project files, write code, run terminal commands, and inspect errors directly in the workspace.

All the data in this folder was extracted directly from the actual session transcripts stored in folders `1` and `2`.
